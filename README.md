# helpStrangers
This is a public repo to help strangers with basic C++.  I am not an expert, but I can help with the basics.

The "study" programs are from class lectures where a student provided the copied code.  I fixed the code
where needed so it would compile, and annotated my solutions.  They work and would get you an "A" but they
are by no means the most elegant ways to solve problems in C++.

The "fixed" ones are demonstrably improved from the code provided.  The "EC" ones are extra credit or stretch assignment solutions.
The "tester" ones are optimized for cmdline runs with output to a text file.
I may or may not provide a multi-test run version.
