# helpStrangers
This is a public repo to help strangers with basic C++.  I am not an expert, but I can help with the basics.
This work is a reaction to news that a class is being taught without a recitation.  This is the recitation.

The "study" programs are from class lectures where a student provided the copied code.  If it is "open" that means the code was from another book, and I truncated the source to allow you to code a solution.
I fixed the codewhere needed so it would compile, and annotated my solutions.  They work and would get you an "A" but they are by no means the most elegant ways to solve problems in C++.  Obviously you should not submit these for any kind of grade; the expectation is you can read the solution and understand it sufficiently to roll your own.

The "fixed" ones are demonstrably improved from the code provided.  The "EC" ones are extra credit or stretch assignment solutions.
The "tester" ones are optimized for cmdline runs with output to a text file.
I may or may not provide a multi-test run version.
