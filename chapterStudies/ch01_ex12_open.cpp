/*
12. A simple rule to estimate your ideal body weight is to allow 110 pounds for the
first 5 feet of height and 5 pounds for each additional inch. Write a program with
a variable for the height of a person in feet and another variable for the additional
inches and input values for these variables from the keyboard. Assume the person
is at least 5 feet tall. For example, a person that is 6 feet and 3 inches tall would be
represented with a variable that stores the number 6 and another variable that stores
the number 3. Based on these values calculate and output the ideal body weight.

Sample output:

    You must be at least five feet tall to run this program.
    How tall are you in feet? 6
    And how many inches? 1
    Ideal bodyweight for someone 6 feet 1 inches is 175 pounds.
