One gallon is 3785.41 milliliters. Write a program that will read the volume of
a package of milk in milliliters, and output the volume in gallons, as well as the
number of packets needed to yield one gallon of milk.

Sample dialog:

    Enter a pkg of milk in mls: 500
    The pkg containing 500ml yields about 0.132086 gallons.
    Moreover you need 7.57082 packages to equal a gallon.
