/*
A government research lab has concluded that an artificial sweetener commonly
used in diet soda will cause death in laboratory mice. A friend of yours is desperate
to lose weight but cannot give up soda. Your friend wants to know how much diet
soda it is possible to drink without dying as a result. Write a program to supply
the answer. The input to the program is the amount of artificial sweetener needed
to kill a mouse, the weight of the mouse, and the weight of the dieter. To ensure
the safety of your friend, be sure the program requests the weight at which the
dieter will stop dieting, rather than the dieterâ€™s current weight. Assume that diet
soda contains one-tenth of 1% artificial sweetener. Use a variable declaration with
the modifier const to give a name to this fraction. You may want to express the
percentage as the double value 0.001

Sample dialog:

    Find out how much diet soda will kill your friend.
    Tell me the weight of your test mouse, in grams: 113
    Tell me in grams how much sweetener kills the mouse: 1
    Finally how much your human will weigh, in kilograms: 100
    And how much your human PLANS TO WEIGH when done with the diet, in kilograms: 85
    Great.
    One can of diet Blerf contains: 0.3024 grams of death sauce.
    A mouse weighing 113 grams dies after consuming 1 grams of sweetner, which takes 3.307 cans of diet Blerf.
    Your human weighing 100 kilograms dies after consuming 885 grams of sweetner, which takes 2926.44 cans of diet Blerf.
    Your human after losing 15 kilograms dies after consuming 752.212 grams of sweetner, which takes 2487.47 cans of diet Blerf.
