4. Write a program that finds and prints all of the prime numbers between 3 and 100.
A prime number is a number that can only be divided by one and itself (i.e., 3, 5,
7, 11, 13, 17, . . .).
One way to solve this problem is to use a doubly-nested loop. The outer loop can
iterate from 3 to 100, while the inner loop checks to see whether the counter
value for the outer loop is prime. One way to decide whether the number n is
prime is to loop from 2 to n - 1; if any of these numbers evenly divides n, then
n cannot be prime. If none of the values from 2 to n - 1 evenly divide n, then
n must be prime. (Note that there are several easy ways to make this algorithm
more efficient.)

Finding primes suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks.
